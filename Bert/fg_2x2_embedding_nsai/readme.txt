There are major three versions of the experiment:

1. In version 1 the items involve verbs that are optionally intransitive (e.g. "talk (about)")
2. In version 2 the items involve verbs that are not optionally intransitive (e.g. "relied on")
3. In version 3 both versions are compounded.

Overall, results are the same.

There are also two minor versions of the experiment:

1. With sentence final punctuation (punct)
2. Without sentence final punctuation

Overall, results are the same. BERT's [SEP] separator seems to ensure this.
